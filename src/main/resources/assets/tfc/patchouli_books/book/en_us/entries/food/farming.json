The hoe works like in Vanilla, $(4)right-clicking$() to make farmland, however farmland is a little more complex than in vanilla. Each farmland block has a moisture value ranging from $(thing)0$() (dry) to $(thing)15$() (wet). Proximity to water sources increases the moisture level, as well as rain."

Plant them in the spring, and you may be able to get 2 or even 3 harvests if you manage their planting regularly. A crop is typically considered mature when it turns into a golden brown color, though this isn't always the case. Some plants, like bell peppers and tomatoes, produce vegetables that you can pick with $(4)right-click$(), instead of destroying the whole plant."

However, when broken, dead crops will give more seeds than a regular crop. Letting some crops die is a useful technique for expanding the size of your farm."
